WARNING: We must know the workload before we do optimization!

== What does malloc and free do

We should keep a set of free memory intervals stem:[\bigcup_i [L_i, R_i)], where these intervals are got from OS.

malloc: find an interval stem:[[l, r)] from stem:[\bigcup_i [L_i, R_i)]

free: for given stem:[l] delete stem:[[l, r)]

. how to manage the intervals

. how to find stem:[r] when only stem:[l] given: store a meta info before stem:[l] as header

== Workload

*Parallel* is the most important thing. Modern CPU may have 128 threads running in 128 cores. A coarse-grained lock may destroy the whole system.

Use `ltrace` to get the allocation pattern from different applications.

```bash
ltrace -f -e 'malloc+free-@libc.so*' $@ > /dev/null
```

== Modern malloc

TIP: Fast path and slow path. Small allocation may be frequency.

* Fast Path
+
--
Slab allocator: For common sizes generate a **thread local**(lock free, or race with `free`) memory pool. Like for 4B, 8B, ..., every block in this pool has the same size, and store a meta data at hte head of this pool, recording the allocation status of the blocks.

A big data structure and lock.

Almost every modern implmentation is based on it.

glibc: arena->heap->tcache(thread-local)

TCMalloc: cental free list, thread-caching malloc

OpenGDK: ZGC: region based + tlab(thread-local)
