## `shared_ptr`

I met a problem when I initialize an object.

```cpp
std::shared_ptr<Logger> logger(new Logger("root"));
```
```
error: no matching function for call to â€˜mysylar::Logger::Logger(mysylar::Logger*)
```

It is caused by passing rvalue to the constructor. The following code can be compiled successfully.

```cpp
std::string name = "root";
std::shared_ptr<Logger> logger(new Logger(name));
```

Use c++11 standard also can solve this problem.
