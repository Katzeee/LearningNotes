=== GPU Composition

* TPC: Texture Processor Cluster
* SM: Streaming Multiprocessor
* SP: Streaming Processor
* ALU
* FPU
* SFU: Special Function Unit
* ROP: Render Output Unit
* Warp Scheduler
* LD/ST: Load/Store Unit
* GPC: Graphic Processor Cluster
* Cuda Core: uniform computation arch
* RT Core
* Tensor Core: for tensor, matrix computation

=== How do shader codes run on `Fermi` architecture

*1. From CPU to GPU*

The program send `Grapics API drawcalls` to GPU drivers, then drivers store them in `Push buffer`. After some time or call `flush` explicitly, GPU will receive these the commands from `Host Interface` and excute them in `Front End`.

The work will be distributed by `Primitive Distributor`: batch the vertices in `Index buffer` and send them to ``GPCs``.

*2. Geometry step*

In `Vertex Fetch` step, `Poly Morph Engine` in `SM` will retrive the vertices data. Afterwards, the data will be divided into warps which is composed by *32* threads(SIMT). `Warp Scheduler` will distribute the commands as the order of GPU receiving. 

The command excution will be `lock-step` in one single warp, which means the 32 threads will be excuting the same instruction at the same time.

NOTE: `lock-step` will result in the low excution speed of `if-else` in shader. Because some of the threads' data run on the `true` branch and some on `false`, then the 32 threads must wait for other threads to finish all the branch. (Another brnach will be masked out for one thread)

One warp may excute many times to finish(store the intermediate result then load it again), especially for those time-consuming instructions like read texture.

SFU for sin, cos, sqrt.

LD/ST for loading uniform variables.

*3. Rasterizer*

Clip and transform in `Viewport Transform` module, then resterize the triangles to pixels.

NOTE: Data comunication between vertex shader and pixel shader is via L1 and L2 Cache.

Then the pixel data will be distributed to ``GPC``s again, this distribution is decided by the aera of which tile does the pixel at.

*4. Pixel Step*

`Raster Engine` works for generating the interpolated data and culling(back culling and early-Z).

`Atribute Setup` on `SM` ensure that the data from vertex shader is readable by pixel shader(interpolated).

32 threads group as a warp or we say 8 `2x2 pixel tile` is the smallest work group for pixel shader.

TIP: `2x2 pixel tile` is designed to get the `ddx` and `ddy` of one pixel, for calculating the mipmap level of it.

Finally, the data will passed to `ROP` for depth test, blend or something.

NOTE: The manipulate of the depth and color data must be atomic.

=== Vector vs Scalar

Scalar: do a scalar operation for all thread in one work group to save cycles.

=== Context 

One GPU Core can be abstrcted to A `Fetch/Decode Module`, some ``ALUs``, and some ``Contexts``. ``ALUs`` are responsible for excuting the commands and ``Contexts`` are the context of the ``ALUs``.

One instruction is excuted by one `ALU` in one `Context`.

If there is a time-consuming instruction, the scheduler can let the `ALU` to excute in another context to avoid blocking.

*1. What are in Context*

* General Purpose Registers(GPR)

* Local variables, Varyings

*2. What should we do*

* Use less GPR in one shader, makes more warp in one SM, then less latency when retriving textures.

* Devide one complex pass into more simple passes

* Sampling texture may use more GPRs

=== Memory Hiearchy

=== Compute Shader 

image::/assets/images/2024-09-01-compute-shader-system-values.png[]

=== Optimization 

* Customize geometry instancing to replace the static batching and dynamic batching in Unity, which will merge mesh incresing VBO memory, and cause heavy CPU consumption, respectively.

* Decrease the number of vertices and triangles to decrease the consumption of VS, PS and data storage.3D objects should use LOD.

* Avoid transfering data to GPU every frame. In Unity, use GPU particle to instead CPU particle. Avoid large amount of transparency particle, which will cause overdraw.

* Avoid rendering status setting and fetching, like set shader property in `Update()`, because CPU communicate with GPU through `MMIO`.

* *Enable mipmap to decrease the texture cache missing.*

* Avoid excessively small triangles which may cause overdrawing, imagine a small triangle is at the center of 4 `2x2 pixel tile` but only cover the center 4 pixels, then the 4 tiles must calculate for this triangle and mask the other result.

== Moblie GPU

=== Types

* Mali

* Adreno(From AMD Imageon)

* PowerVR

NOTE: Battery-cosuming = Hot = Low FPS Most battery-cosuming part is GPU and memory.

=== Difference from Desktop

Low frequency, high amount of ALU

Bandwidth optimization: tile-based rendering

* Desktop GPU use Immediate Mode Rendering(IMR)

** Optimizition:
+
--
Position data use seperate buffer, if vertex is culled, then GPU will not fetch the other vertex data.

=== TBR vs TBDR

* Mali and Adreno 
+
--
Low-cost blend, like tiled IMR. 
--

* PowerVR 
+
--
High-cost blend, blend will flush HSR.

Discard need write z to HSR(consuming).
