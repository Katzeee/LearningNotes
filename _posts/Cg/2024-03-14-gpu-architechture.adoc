== GPU Composition

* TPC: Texture Processor Cluster
* SM: Streaming Multiprocessor
* SP: Streaming Processor
* ALU
* FPU
* SFU: Special Function Unit
* ROP: Render Output Unit
* Warp Scheduler
* LD/ST: Load/Store Unit
* GPC: Graphic Processor Cluster
* Cuda Core: uniform computation arch
* RT Core
* Tensor Core: for tensor, matrix computation

== How do shader codes run on `Fermi` architecture

*1. From CPU to GPU*

The program send `Grapics API drawcalls` to GPU drivers, then drivers store them in `Push buffer`. After some time or call `flush` explicitly, GPU will receive these the commands from `Host Interface` and excute them in `Front End`.

The work will be distributed by `Primitive Distributor`: batch the vertices in `Index buffer` and send them to ``GPC``s.

*2. Geometry step*

In `Vertex Fetch` step, `Poly Morph Engine` in `SM` will retrive the vertices data. Afterwards, the data will be divided into warps which is composed by *32* threads(SIMT). `Warp Scheduler` will distribute the commands as the order of GPU receiving. 

The command excution will be `lock-step` in one single warp, which means the 32 threads will be excuting the same instruction at the same time.

NOTE: `lock-step` will result in the lower excution speed of `if-else` in shader. Because some of the threads' data go the `if true` and some are `false`, then the 32 threads must wait other thread to finish all the branch. (Another brnach will be masked out for one thread)

One warp may excute many times to finish(store the intermediate result then load it again), especially for those time-consuming instructions like read texture.

*3. Rasterizer*

Clip and transform in `Viewport Transform` module, then resterize the triangles to pixels.

NOTE: Data comunication between vertex shader and pixel shader is via L1 and L2 Cache.

Then the pixel data will be distributed to ``GPC``s again, this distribution is decided by the aera of which tile does the pixel at.

*4. Pixel Step*

`Raster Engine` works for generating the interpolated data and culling(back culling and early-Z).

`Atribute Setup` on `SM` ensure that the data from vertex shader is readable by pixel shader(interpolated).

32 threads group as a warp or we say 8 `2x2 pixel tile` is the smallest work group for pixel shader.

TIP: `2x2 pixel tile` is designed to get the `ddx` and `ddy` of one pixel, for calculating the mipmap level of it.

Finally, the data will passed to `ROP` for depth test, blend or something.

NOTE: The manipulate of the depth and color data must be atomic.

== GPU Context in Core

One GPU Core can be abstrcted to a `Fetch/Decode Module`, some ``ALU``s, and some ``Context``s. ``ALU``s are responsible for excuting the commands and ``Context``s are the context of the ``ALU``s.

One instruction is excuted by one `ALU` in one `Context`.

If there is a time-consuming instruction, the scheduler can let the `ALU` to excute in another context to avoid blocking.

== Optimization 

* Customize geometry instancing to replace the static batching and dynamic batching in Unity, which will merge mesh incresing VBO memory, and cause heavy CPU consumption, respectively.
* Decrease the number of vertices and triangles to decrease the consumption of VS, PS and data storage.3D objects should use LOD.
* Avoid transfering data to GPU every frame. In Unity, use GPU particle to instead CPU particle. Avoid large amount of transparency particle, which will cause overdraw.
* Avoid rendering status setting and fetching, like set shader property in `Update()`, because CPU communicate with GPU through `MMIO`.
* *Enable mipmap to decrease the texture cache missing.*
* Avoid excessively small triangles which may cause overdrawing, imagine a small triangle is at the center of 4 `2x2 pixel tile` but only cover the center 4 pixels, then the 4 tiles must calculate for this triangle and mask the other result.
