= Glsl Uniform Buffer Layout

When I was passing a 64 elements vec3 array to shader, I found it only shows 48 elements.

```glsl
layout(set = 0, binding = 3) readonly buffer _unnamed
{
    highp vec3 sample_point[64];
};
```

768 / 48 = 16, obviously it has been padded to 16 bytes.

== Std140 layout

As the opengl spec says:

1. If the member is a scalar consuming N basic machine units, the base alignment is N.
2. If the member is a two- or four-component vector with components consuming N basic machine units, the base alignment is 2N or 4N, respectively.
3. If the member is a three-component vector with components consuming N
basic machine units, the base alignment is 4N.
4. If the member is an array of scalars or vectors, the base alignment and array
stride are set to match the base alignment of a single array element, according
to rules (1), (2), and (3), and rounded up to the base alignment of a vec4. The
array may have padding at the end; the base offset of the member following
the array is rounded up to the next multiple of the base alignment.
5. If the member is a column-major matrix with C columns and R rows, the
matrix is stored identically to an array of C column vectors with R components each, according to rule (4).
6. If the member is an array of S column-major matrices with C columns and
R rows, the matrix is stored identically to a row of S x C column vectors
with R components each, according to rule (4).
7. If the member is a row-major matrix with C columns and R rows, the matrix
is stored identically to an array of R row vectors with C components each,
according to rule (4).
8. If the member is an array of S row-major matrices with C columns and R
rows, the matrix is stored identically to a row of S x R row vectors with C
components each, according to rule (4).
9. If the member is a structure, the base alignment of the structure is N, where
N is the largest base alignment value of any of its members, and rounded
up to the base alignment of a vec4. The individual members of this substructure are then assigned offsets by applying this set of rules recursively,
where the base offset of the first member of the sub-structure is equal to the
aligned offset of the structure. The structure may have padding at the end;
the base offset of the member following the sub-structure is rounded up to
the next multiple of the base alignment of the structure.
10. If the member is an array of S structures, the S elements of the array are laid
out in order, according to rule (9).

Shader storage blocks (see section 7.8) also support the std140 layout qualifier, as well as a std430 qualifier not supported for uniform blocks. When using the std430 storage layout, shader storage blocks will be laid out in buffer storage *identically to uniform and shader storage blocks using the std140 layout*, except that the base alignment and stride of arrays of scalars and vectors in rule 4 and of structures in rule 9 are not rounded up a multiple of the base alignment of a vec4.

For example:

```glsl
layout(std140) uniform test {
    float a; // offset 0
    float b; // offset 4
    vec3 f; // offset 16
    float s; // offset 28
};


layout(std140) uniform test {
    float a; // offset 0
    float b; // offset 4
    vec3 f; // offset 16
    vec3 s; // offset 32
};

struct st{
    float b;
};

layout(std140) uniform test {
    st c; // offset 0
    float d; // offset 16
};

layout(std140) uniform test{
    mat3x3 mat1; // offset 0
    mat3x3 mat; // offset 48
};

layout(std140) uniform test {
float a[3]; // a[0] offset 0, a[1] offset 16, a[2] offset 32

};

layout(std140) uniform test{
    float a; // offset 0
    mat4x4 b; // offset 16
};
```
