Unity provides you a `Post` method to send a post request, but it has some limitations.

```cs
WWWForm form;
UnityWebRequest request = UnityWebRequest.Post(URL, form);
```

* `form.header` is read only

* Can't change the `Content-Type` by manipulate `request`

I've tried to change the `Content-Type` like this, but it doesn't work

```cs
request.SetRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
```

What you can do is to create a raw http request then fill it yourself.

```cs
Dictionary<string, string> form = new Dictionary<string, string>();
form["name"] = taskName;
UnityWebRequest request = new UnityWebRequest(MeshyGlobalConfig.T2M_URL, "POST");
request.SetRequestHeader("Authorization", EditorPrefs.GetString(API_KEY_FIELD));
request.SetRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
request.downloadHandler = new DownloadHandlerBuffer();
byte[] body = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(form));
request.uploadHandler = new UploadHandlerRaw(body);
request.SendWebRequest().completed += OnSubmited;
```
